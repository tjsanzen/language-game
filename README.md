# Language Guessing Game

A small game I made in my free time that simply allows players
to guess what language is written or being spoken, simply based
on the text and/or audio sample provided. 

All language sound clips are from Article 1 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, taken from Omniglot.com.

Another very cool site to check out is https://www.localingual.com/
which allows you to select a country and listen to words in each
language with that accent.
